# Zig-JSON

JSON implemented purely in Zig.  It supports all types commonly supported (float - including exponent form, integers, boolean, null, maps, arrays, and strings).

It also supports comments.  You should be able to just compile the scripts and add through your build script.  Maybe Zig needs a build manager mhmmm.
